A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/whqet/pen/Auzch.

 Learn to make a fireworks display with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. In this demo, the pixel sized rockets launch from the bottom of the screen automatically, and by the click of your mouse. You can also click and drag to launch multiple fireworks.

The tutorial covers keeping track of and looping over objects contained in arrays, tracking mouse clicks and coordinates, animating fireworks to specific target coordinates, and making beautiful particle explosions through the use of randomly generated values.

Feel free to play with the config variables in the JS code to have fun with the experiment.
